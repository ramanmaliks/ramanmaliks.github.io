Strangle Option Strategy
A strangle is an options trading strategy where an investor holds both a call and a put option on the same underlying asset, with different strike prices but the same expiration date.

Here's the breakdown:

Call option: Gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a certain price (strike price) by the expiration date.
Put option: Gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a certain price (strike price) by the expiration date.
Key point: The investor is unsure about the direction of the price movement (up or down) but believes there will be significant volatility (price swings) in the near future.

Benefits:

Profits if the underlying asset price moves significantly in either direction.
Drawbacks:

Requires a lower upfront investment compared to a straddle (explained later).
Needs a larger price movement to become profitable due to the difference in strike prices.
Loses money if the price remains stagnant or moves slightly.
Here's an example to illustrate:

Imagine you believe the price of a stock (XYZ) will experience a major price swing but are unsure if it will go up or down. The current stock price is $100.

You buy a call option with a strike price of $120 (out-of-the-money) and a put option with a strike price of $80 (out-of-the-money), both expiring in 3 months.
Profitable scenarios:

If the stock price rises significantly above $120 by expiration, the call option becomes profitable.
If the stock price falls significantly below $80 by expiration, the put option becomes profitable.

The diagram will illustrate how the strangle profits if the price moves significantly in either direction.

Important to remember:

Strangles are complex strategies and involve risks.
Options trading requires a good understanding of options Greeks and market volatility.
Consider consulting with a financial advisor before implementing a strangle strategy.
